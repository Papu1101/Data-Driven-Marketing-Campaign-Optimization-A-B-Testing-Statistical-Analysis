# Data-Driven-Marketing-Campaign-Optimization-A-B-Testing-Statistical-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of digital marketing campaigns across two platforms—Facebook and Instagram—using data-driven statistical techniques. The primary objective is to understand whether increased advertising engagement (clicks and spend) genuinely leads to higher conversions .


# Marketing Campaign Performance Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes digital marketing campaign data to evaluate the effectiveness of Facebook and Instagram advertisements. Using statistical techniques such as A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis, the project aims to determine whether increased ad engagement leads to higher conversions and how marketing budgets can be optimized.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Compare Facebook vs Instagram campaign performance
- Determine whether higher clicks lead to more conversions
- Identify cost-efficient periods for running campaigns
- Provide data-driven budget allocation recommendations

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains daily campaign-level data for one year, including:
- Ad views
- Clicks
- Conversions
- Advertising cost
- Conversion categories
- Campaign platform (Facebook / Instagram)

## 🛠️ Key Analysis Performed
### 1. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Handled missing values
- Created key metrics:
  - Click-Through Rate (CTR)
  - Conversion Rate
  - Cost Per Click (CPC)
  - Cost Per Conversion

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis
- Outlier detection
- Weekly and monthly trend analysis
- Seasonality insights

### 3. A/B Testing
- Compared Facebook and Instagram conversion performance
- Tested whether observed differences were statistically significant

### 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Evaluated whether increased clicks significantly impact conversions
- Tested assumptions using statistical significance (p-values)

### 5. Regression Analysis
- Quantified the relationship between:
  - Ad spend
  - Clicks
  - Conversions
- Assessed the strength and direction of impact

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Clicks and conversions show a positive but not perfectly proportional relationship
- Certain days of the week and months consistently outperform others
- Lower CPC periods indicate better ROI opportunities
- Increasing spend alone does not guarantee higher conversions

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Allocate higher budgets during historically high-performing periods
- Focus on platforms with better cost-efficiency, not just higher traffic
- Optimize campaigns based on conversion efficiency rather than clicks alone

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy / Statsmodels
- Jupyter Notebook
